# Persona-Specific Talking Points

## CIO: Business Value & ROI

**Their Concerns:**
- Budget constraints (merger integration costs)
- Tool standardization across ACME + Initech
- Risk mitigation for cloud vendor lock-in

**Your Messages:**
- "Single platform reduces licensing costs 40% vs tool sprawl"
- "Same Terraform code works for Initech's infrastructure day one"
- "Cloud-agnostic = negotiating leverage with AWS/GCP"
- "Terraform Cloud provides audit trails for compliance"

**Demo Callouts:**
- Point out: "Same code, two clouds - imagine this for 50 teams"
- Show workspace model: "Each BU gets isolated workspace, shared modules"
- Mention: "This is how Fortune 500s standardize provisioning"

**Competitive Positioning:**
- vs Build Custom: "Your team focuses on business logic, not platform maintenance"
- vs Pulumi: "HCL is infrastructure-focused, not general programming language"

## Cloud Architect: Technical Depth

**Their Concerns:**
- Multi-cloud networking complexity
- State management at scale
- Security and compliance controls
- Integration with existing tools

**Your Messages:**
- "Provider abstraction without losing cloud-native features"
- "Remote state with locking prevents concurrent modification disasters"
- "Sentinel policies enforce security guardrails"
- "Works with your existing Git workflow, no new paradigm"

**Demo Callouts:**
- Explain provider blocks: "Notice GCP and AWS coexist cleanly"
- Show module structure: "Reusable patterns, consistent across clouds"
- Point to state file: "Single source of truth, encrypted at rest"
- VCS integration: "GitOps workflow you already understand"

**Technical Deep-Dives (if asked):**
- Cross-cloud networking: "Terraform can provision VPN/interconnects"
- Drift detection: "terraform plan shows infrastructure vs code delta"
- Secrets management: "Integrates with Vault for dynamic credentials" (segue to bonus)

**Competitive Positioning:**
- vs Ansible: "Ansible is imperative, Terraform is declarative - see the difference?"
- vs CloudFormation: "Single tool vs learning three different DSLs"

## DevOps Engineer: Workflow & Productivity

**Their Concerns:**
- Learning curve for team
- Integration with CI/CD
- Day-to-day operational friction
- Debugging failed deployments

**Your Messages:**
- "If you know Git, you know 80% of the workflow"
- "CLI for local dev, Terraform Cloud for team coordination"
- "Plan-apply workflow prevents surprises in production"
- "Rich provider ecosystem - 3000+ integrations"

**Demo Callouts:**
- Show `terraform plan` output: "See exactly what changes before applying"
- CLI workflow: "Same commands locally and in CI/CD"
- Module usage: "Write once, use everywhere - DRY principle"
- Error messages: "Clear output tells you exactly what failed"

**Workflow Examples:**
- "Developer opens PR → Terraform plan runs → Team reviews → Merge = apply"
- "No more ServiceNow tickets for infrastructure changes"
- "Self-service for app teams within policy guardrails"

**Competitive Positioning:**
- vs Python scripts: "Type safety, validation, community modules"
- vs Ansible: "Infrastructure-specific tool vs config management overlap"

---

## SRE: Reliability & Operations

**Their Concerns:**
- Rollback capabilities
- Blast radius limitation
- Observability and troubleshooting
- Disaster recovery

**Your Messages:**
- "Infrastructure as code = reproducible disaster recovery"
- "Workspaces isolate environments - dev can't break prod"
- "State versioning allows rollback to previous configurations"
- "Audit logs show who changed what when"

**Demo Callouts:**
- Show workspace isolation: "Separate state = limited blast radius"
- Explain outputs: "Structured data for monitoring integrations"
- State locking: "Prevents concurrent changes causing conflicts"
- Remote execution: "Consistent execution environment, no local machine drift"

**Operational Scenarios:**
- Disaster recovery: "terraform apply in new region, infrastructure identical"
- Compliance audit: "VCS history shows every infrastructure change"
- Troubleshooting: "State file shows actual vs desired, pinpoint issues"

**Competitive Positioning:**
- vs Manual: "Documented in code, not tribal knowledge"
- vs Snowflake servers: "Repeatable, testable, version controlled"

## Cross-Cutting Themes (Use Throughout)

### Theme 1: Merger Integration
**Message**: "Terraform is your merger integration platform"
- Initech's infrastructure becomes Terraform code
- Standardization happens through module library
- No forced migration, gradual adoption possible

### Theme 2: Platform Thinking (Vault Integration)
**Message**: "This is part of a complete platform"
- Terraform provisions infrastructure
- Vault secures secrets (show in demo)
- Consul connects services (mention for future)
- Nomad orchestrates workloads (mention for future)

### Theme 3: Community & Ecosystem
**Message**: "You're not alone - massive community"
- 3000+ providers available
- Active community, stack overflow support
- HashiCorp professional services available
- Huge module registry (Terraform Registry)

## Objection Handling

### "We already use Ansible"
**Response**: "Terraform and Ansible complement each other. Terraform provisions infrastructure (immutable), Ansible configures software (mutable). Many customers use both - Terraform for cloud resources, Ansible for application config."

### "This looks complex"
**Response**: "Fair point - IaC has a learning curve. But compare it to maintaining Python scripts across 50 teams, debugging CloudFormation in three clouds, or ServiceNow tickets. The complexity is fronted, then you get exponential productivity gains."

### "What about Pulumi?"
**Response**: "Pulumi's great if you want to use TypeScript/Python. We see customers prefer HCL because it's declarative and purpose-built for infrastructure. Less abstraction = easier to debug. Plus, HCL has 10 years of production hardening."

### "Can we build this ourselves?"
**Response**: "Your team definitely could - you have the talent. Question is: do you want to maintain a provisioning platform, or deliver business value? We estimate 3-4 FTEs maintaining a custom platform vs using Terraform. Where would you rather invest those engineers?"

### "What about Kubernetes for everything?"
**Response**: "K8s is great for container orchestration. Terraform provisions the K8s clusters themselves, plus databases, networking, IAM - all the foundational infrastructure K8s sits on top of. Complementary, not competitive."

## Closing Moves

**Soft Close (if positive):**
"Based on what you've seen, does this approach solve your merger integration challenge?"

**Next Step (always propose):**
"I'd suggest a 2-week POC - we provision one of your existing workloads using Terraform. You get hands-on experience, we prove value. Sound reasonable?"

**Executive Sponsor (if CIO engaged):**
"I can connect you with [Account Executive] who can discuss enterprise licensing and get you a reference call with [similar company]."

**Technical Depth (if engineers engaged):**
"I can arrange a deeper technical session with our Solutions Architect to design your specific architecture. When works for your team?"
