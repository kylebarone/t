# Technical Discovery: ACME Multi-Cloud Initiative

## Business Context

**Situation**: ACME Corp acquiring Initech, requires multi-cloud strategy  
**Timeline**: Budget planning cycle, CTO needs decision within weeks  
**Revenue Impact**: $500M+ combined company, infrastructure standardization critical  
**Key Driver**: Eliminate AWS vendor lock-in, enable negotiating position

---

## Current State Assessment

### Infrastructure Footprint

**ACME Corp:**
- **Cloud**: AWS-only (6 years)
- **Workloads**: 200+ EC2 instances, 50+ RDS databases, 30+ S3 buckets
- **Provisioning**: Custom Python scripts (5000+ LOC, maintained by 2 engineers)
- **Management**: ServiceNow for infrastructure requests (average 3-5 day SLA)

**Initech (Acquiring):**
- **Cloud**: GCP-primary, some Azure (4 years)
- **Workloads**: 150+ GCE instances, 40+ Cloud SQL, GKE clusters
- **Provisioning**: Ansible playbooks (fragmented across teams)
- **Management**: Ad-hoc requests via Slack + Jira

### Pain Points (Prioritized by Stakeholder)

**CIO Pain:**
1. Can't negotiate with AWS - locked in
2. Tool standardization across merged entity
3. Infrastructure costs ballooning (no optimization)
4. Compliance/audit trail gaps

**Cloud Architect Pain:**
1. Python scripts brittle, break frequently
2. No consistent patterns across teams
3. Can't reuse infrastructure patterns
4. Multi-cloud networking unknown territory

**DevOps Engineer Pain:**
1. ServiceNow ticketing bottleneck
2. Each team reinvents the wheel
3. No testing for infrastructure changes
4. Onboarding new engineers takes months

**SRE Pain:**
1. Disaster recovery is manual, error-prone
2. Can't reproduce environments reliably
3. Drift between declared and actual state
4. Incident response slowed by snowflake servers

## Requirements Gathering

### Functional Requirements

**Must Have:**
- [x] Provision infrastructure across AWS, GCP, Azure
- [x] Version control for infrastructure (Git-based)
- [x] Team collaboration (multiple engineers working simultaneously)
- [x] Environment isolation (dev/staging/prod)
- [x] Audit trail (who changed what when)

**Should Have:**
- [x] Reusable modules/patterns
- [x] Policy enforcement (security/compliance guardrails)
- [x] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [x] Cost visibility per environment/team

**Nice to Have:**
- [ ] GUI for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] Cost estimation before deployment
- [ ] Automatic drift detection/remediation
- [ ] Integration with CMDB (ServiceNow)

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- Provision standard 3-tier app in < 30 minutes
- Support 50+ concurrent infrastructure changes

**Security:**
- Secrets management (no credentials in code)
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging to SIEM

**Scalability:**
- Support 100+ teams
- Manage 10,000+ cloud resources
- Multi-region deployments

**Reliability:**
- 99.9% uptime for control plane
- Rollback capability for failed changes
- State backup and recovery

---

## Technical Constraints

**Organizational:**
- Teams have varying technical maturity (skill gap)
- Resistance to change from "it works today" mindset
- Limited budget for training/onboarding

**Technical:**
- Existing AWS infrastructure must coexist during migration
- GCP committed use contracts (Initech)
- Air-gapped environments for PCI workloads (future)
- Integration with Okta (SSO requirement)

**Timeline:**
- POC required within 4 weeks
- Decision by end of Q4
- Rollout plan for Q1 next year

---

## Competitive Landscape

**Tools Currently Being Evaluated:**

1. **Pulumi** (exploring)
   - Pro: Teams already know Python
   - Con: Less mature, fewer providers

2. **CloudFormation + ARM Templates + Deployment Manager**
   - Pro: Native to each cloud
   - Con: Learn 3 DSLs, no cross-cloud

3. **Build Custom Platform** (serious consideration)
   - Pro: Tailored to exact needs
   - Con: Ongoing maintenance burden

4. **Ansible** (some teams using)
   - Pro: Already in use
   - Con: Not purpose-built for infrastructure

**Current Vendor Relationships:**
- **AWS**: Enterprise agreement, 20% discount
- **GCP**: Initech has $2M committed spend
- **HashiCorp**: No existing relationship (Terraform OSS used informally by 3 engineers)

---

## Success Criteria

**Technical Success:**
- Deploy widget application to GCP + AWS using single tool
- 80%+ reduction in deployment time vs current process
- Zero manual steps in deployment workflow
- Infrastructure changes via pull request process

**Business Success:**
- CIO approves standardization on single platform
- Cloud Architect endorses architecture approach
- DevOps engineers prefer new workflow over old
- SRE confident in disaster recovery capability

**Deal Success:**
- POC completed within 4 weeks
- Terraform Enterprise license (100 users) approved
- Professional services engagement for migration
- Customer reference agreement secured

---

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems to Integrate

**Source Control:**
- GitHub Enterprise (primary)
- GitLab (some teams, Initech)

**CI/CD:**
- Jenkins (ACME)
- CircleCI (Initech)
- GitHub Actions (pilot teams)

**Security/Compliance:**
- Okta (SSO)
- Splunk (SIEM)
- ServiceNow (CMDB/ITSM)

**Monitoring:**
- Datadog (ACME)
- Prometheus/Grafana (Initech)

### Future HashiCorp Platform Expansion

**Vault** (mentioned in discovery):
- Recent breach exposed static credentials
- Need dynamic secrets for databases
- Perfect integration story with Terraform

**Consul** (potential future need):
- Microservices discovery (if they go that route)
- Multi-cloud service mesh
- Not immediate priority

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk:**
- [ ] Resistance from teams invested in custom Python scripts
- [ ] Learning curve slows initial productivity
- [ ] Failed demo = lose to "build it ourselves" option

**Medium Risk:**
- [ ] Integration complexity with existing CI/CD
- [ ] Air-gapped environment requirements (PCI)
- [ ] Cost model clarity (per-user vs per-run)

**Low Risk:**
- [ ] Technical capability of Terraform (proven at scale)
- [ ] Community support and ecosystem
- [ ] Vendor stability (HashiCorp established)

## Discovery Questions Answered

**Q: Why now?**  
A: Merger forces decision. Can't have 2 different approaches. Budget cycle = forcing function.

**Q: What happens if no decision?**  
A: Each team continues fragmented approach. Merger integration delayed 6-12 months. Competitive disadvantage.

**Q: Who has decision authority?**  
A: CTO final say. Needs buy-in from CIO (budget) and Cloud Architect (technical validation).

**Q: What's the competitive threat?**  
A: Build-it-ourselves is real option. CIO quote: "We have smart engineers, why pay for a tool?"

**Q: What would make them choose us?**  
A: Prove faster time-to-value than building custom. Show platform thinking (Vault integration). Demonstrate at-scale customer references.

## Recommendation

**Proposed Solution**: Terraform Enterprise + Terraform Cloud  
**Deployment Model**: SaaS (Terraform Cloud) for speed, option for self-hosted later  
**Licensing**: Start with 50 users (pilot teams), expand to 100+ post-POC  

**Demo Strategy**:
1. Show multi-cloud provisioning (addresses core requirement)
2. Show VCS workflow (addresses collaboration pain)
3. Show Vault integration (addresses security concern, platform story)
4. Compare to their current Python script approach (competitive positioning)

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Technical demo (this presentation)
- [ ] POC agreement (4 weeks)
- [ ] Executive briefing with CTO
- [ ] Pricing proposal
- [ ] Customer reference call setup
