## What We Have

**Business Context:**
- ACME + Initech merger driving multi-cloud need
- Python scripts, ServiceNow, Ansible fragmentation
- CTO needs decision ASAP (budget cycle)

**Technical Solution:**
- Terraform provisions GCP + AWS simultaneously
- Single codebase, multiple clouds
- Bonus: Vault integration for database secrets
- Addresses Terraform 2 (primary) + Terraform 1 (bonus) requirements

**Demo Ready:**
- 20-minute flow mapped out
- Persona-specific talking points prepared
- Architecture diagrams ready to present
- Complete Terraform code structure defined

## Next Steps - Stage 2: Build

### Immediate Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Setup Cloud Accounts**
   - [ ] GCP project with billing enabled
   - [ ] AWS account with programmatic access
   - [ ] Terraform Cloud free account

2. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - [ ] Initialize repo: `acme-multicloud-demo`
   - [ ] Add .gitignore for Terraform
   - [ ] Push initial structure

3. **Write Terraform Code** (following terraform-code-structure.md)
   - [ ] terraform.tf (backend + providers)
   - [ ] variables.tf (all input variables)
   - [ ] outputs.tf (all outputs)
   - [ ] gcp.tf (GKE + Cloud SQL)
   - [ ] aws.tf (EKS + RDS)
   - [ ] vault.tf (bonus integration)
   - [ ] modules/widget-api/
   - [ ] modules/database/

4. **Test Deployment**
   - [ ] terraform init
   - [ ] terraform plan
   - [ ] terraform apply
   - [ ] Verify resources in consoles
   - [ ] terraform destroy (clean up)

5. **Create Demo Assets**
   - [ ] Render Mermaid diagrams to PNG/SVG
   - [ ] Create presentation slides (optional)
   - [ ] Record backup video (if demo fails)

6. **Rehearse Demo**
   - [ ] Practice demo flow 3 times
   - [ ] Time each section
   - [ ] Prepare for common questions
   - [ ] Test error recovery scenarios

---

## Key Success Factors

**Demo Must Accomplish:**
- ✓ Show multi-cloud provisioning live (GCP + AWS)
- ✓ Demonstrate Git workflow integration
- ✓ Prove single tool replaces fragmented approach
- ✓ Address all 4 personas (CIO, Architect, DevOps, SRE)
- ✓ Bonus: Show Vault integration (platform thinking)

**Competitive Advantages:**
- Better than custom Python (maintainability)
- Better than cloud-native tools (vendor neutrality)
- Better than Ansible (purpose-built for infrastructure)
- Platform ecosystem (Terraform + Vault integration)

**Risk Mitigations:**
- Pre-deploy resources if network unreliable
- Have backup slides showing expected output
- Record successful run as fallback video
- Practice error handling scenarios

---

## Time Estimates

**Code Implementation:** 4-6 hours
- Writing Terraform: 2-3 hours
- Testing deployment: 1-2 hours
- Debugging issues: 1 hour buffer

**Demo Preparation:** 2-3 hours
- Creating slides/visuals: 1 hour
- Rehearsal runs: 1-2 hours

**Total Time to Demo-Ready:** 6-9 hours

---

## Resource Requirements

**Cloud Costs:**
- GCP: ~$0.12/hour
- AWS: ~$0.12/hour
- Total: ~$0.25/hour (~$6 for 24-hour period)

**Recommendation:** Deploy 1 hour before demo, destroy immediately after.

**Tools Needed:**
- Terraform CLI (v1.0+)
- gcloud CLI
- aws CLI
- Git
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)
- Mermaid CLI (for rendering diagrams)

---

## Decision Points

### Simplification Options (if time constrained):

**Option A: Skip Vault Integration**
- Focus purely on Terraform multi-cloud
- Still hits primary Terraform 2 requirements
- Saves 2-3 hours implementation time
- Loses platform story bonus

**Option B: Use Pre-built Modules**
- Import from Terraform Registry
- Faster implementation
- Less custom code to explain
- May look "canned"

**Option C: Simplify Infrastructure**
- GCP: Cloud Run instead of GKE
- AWS: Lambda instead of EKS
- Saves cost and complexity
- Loses Kubernetes story

**Recommendation:** Stick to original plan (GKE + EKS + Vault) if you have 6-9 hours available. It's the most impressive demo.

---

## Contingency Plans

**If Demo Fails:**
1. Show recorded video of successful run
2. Walk through code while explaining what WOULD happen
3. Show Terraform Cloud UI with previous successful runs
4. Pivot to architecture discussion using diagrams

**If Questions Go Too Deep:**
1. Acknowledge: "Great question, let me note that for detailed follow-up"
2. Offer: "I can arrange SA deep-dive on that specific topic"
3. Redirect: "For today's demo, let me focus on the core workflow"

**If Time Runs Short:**
1. Skip Vault integration
2. Shorten Q&A
3. Offer follow-up demo for technical deep-dive

## Questions Before Building?

**Technical:**
- Which GCP project ID to use?
- AWS account/region preferences?
- Terraform Cloud organization name?

**Demo Strategy:**
- Live deployment or pre-deployed with updates?
- Full Vault integration or mention only?
- Presentation slides or just live terminal?

**Scope:**
- Any features to add/remove?
- Time constraints we should account for?
